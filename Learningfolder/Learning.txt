I could have started by just creating a GitHub repository and writing stuff directly into GitHub. But I haven't typed a word yet in GitHub. 
I downloaded GitBash. Something I don't fully understand what it is. 
They call it a "console", I believe. It opens a little black screen that opens into the world.
But not my world. A world beyond what I've known. 
This little screen (it's little merely because I don't expand it - because I'm afraid of it engulfing my own self into its darkness) opens up to a kind of Code Lyoko world.
Code Lyoko is my dearest reference. The one I keep closest to my heart. If I think about entering a digital world, Code Lyoko comes to mind immediately.
But no. This is no Code Lyoko. This a (little) black screen. No fancy virtual worlds that are both colorful and obscure. No monsters. 
No romance. No heart beating. Just the pointer's pulse. Just the pointer's inhaling. Exhaling. 

Inhaling. Let an open line to practise branching

Exhaling. Let an open line to understand multiplicity

Inhaling. Learn the bifurcations of the mind made commands

Exhaling. Learn to push.

Pull.

A heartbeat.

Into the void.
