# OMG! Who am I and how did I end up here?

## Technically,

Technically, almost by accident. Hi there, dear reader, my name is Sara, I trust you're well? 
I am a *linguist*. That's what I normally respond to people when they ask me about it. I studied Spanish and English linguistics and literature. I then continued studying English <> Spanish translation, with some e-learning design sparkles here and there. But that's not it. I decided a second master wouldn't hurt much and I'm now studying Discourse analysis focused on media and communication studies. Linguists, am I right? Can we just STOP **analysing** language and just **start doing** something?

Well, I created a GitHub page! And a GitHub repository. And I'm learning basic GIT to get going in GitBash! And I'm currently writing using Markdown syntax (but that's the easiest part, really).
